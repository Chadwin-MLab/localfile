# *Looping in programming*

- Executing a bunch of statements based on some conditions repeatedly.

- *Looping and loops*

-Statements are executed sequentially, interpreted line by line.

- *Two types of iterations*

-Definite iteration, where the number of repetitions is specified explicitly in advance

-Indefinite iteration, in which the code executes until some condition is met.

- *Types of loops*

-For loop, used for definite iteration.

-While loop, used for indefinite iteration.

- *Range in python*

-range(), is a built-in function, used when a user needs to perform an action for a specific number of times.
-commonly used with a for loop.

-usually accepts three arguments:
-Start
-Stop
-Step


# *For Loop*

-Used for sequential transversal.

- Syntax:

- for val in sequence:
    statements


# *While Loop*

-While Loop is used to execute a block of code until a given condition is satisfied

- Syntax

- while boolean_expression:
    statements
