# New Supermarket project

- We will be creating a supermarket software project.

- The cashier would need to enter the product or product code, the quantity and the total bill gets calculated.

- If there is any membership then the customer should get a discount.


# *The Approach*

- We will have a different function for each functionality, and thus call the different functions.

- Sections:

- Entering products

- Calculating price

- Calculating discount

- Making Bill

- The Boiler plate for everything.

- Final code and execution.



# *First Step*

- Accept the name of the product purchased by the customer.

- Accept the quantity of the product purchased.

- The process will need to be looped until all the products are entered.

# *Step two*

- Once the products and quantity is completed.

- We will need to calculate the total price

- We will accept the customers membership.

- depending on the membership we will give discount.

- Three memberships will be present Gold(20%), Silver(10%) and Bronze(5%)

# *Final Step*

- We will calculate the total bill depending on the price of the products and discount.

- We then print the total bill in the output screen.
