*Comments using python code*

It allows us to describe what each part of the code does.


-We use a # to specify Comments

#This is a comment 


-Make use of multi-line comments to comment out several lines of code:

"""

*Working with Data in Python*

- Data is stored in memory and when we want to label it we call that a "variable"


- *What are variables*:
-The container in which we store data

-Variable name:declaring a label to the memory location
-Assigning the value using equals assignment operator
-Give the required value(Data needed to be stored)


- Rules for defining variables:
-Variable names should be meaningful and descriptive
-variable names should start with a letter or _underscore
-variable name cannot start with a number
-variable names are case sensitive so Country,country and COUNTRY are three different variables
-The value needs to be enclosed in quotes



- *Data Types*

-A variable is used to store any type of data required by an app
-Can be word, number, decimal, etc.
-EG

Name = "Frank"
age = 40
Temperature = 38.4

- Different data types:
-Numeric
-Sequence
-Boolean
-Sets
-Mapping Type


- *Working with numbers*

-Most common type of data are numeric, string and boolean

- Numeric:
-Integer: +, - or whole numbers and is represented as int
-Floating point: float, real numbers and are written as decimals
-Complex: can be expressed in the form a+b


- *Working with words*

-Most basic are strings

- Multi-line String:
-You can print multiple string using triple quotes: """ This quote is the one that should be printed """



- *True or False*

-Boolean: evaluating an expression that returns a value, yes or no, true or false. Also called bool.



- *Many times we want to know the type of data store in a variable. This is generally done for the debug and testing process*

-We use the type() function



- *Accepting User Input*

-Tracking a user or a specific calculation based on what the user is busy with
-Use the input() function to interact with users, to get data or a result.
