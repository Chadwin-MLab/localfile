# Most Important and Fundamental concept in python called Functions

# *What are functions?*

- Help us group similar tasks, can be reused and they get executed only when they are called.

- The Basic building blocks of a program.

- A block of code that performs a particular task and may accept optional user inputs and accordingly give outputs.

- This block of code is responsible for a particular task and execute when called.



# *Reusability*

- reusing a particular code, rather than writing the code again.

# *Functions structure and syntax*

- def function_name(parameter1, parameter2..):
    //block of code
    return statement

- "def" is used to define a function. It is followed by the name of the function and parenthesis()

- the body or block of code section may contain one or more python statements.

- It must be indented so it makes a block of code

# *Calling a function*

- To call and execute a function we can simply write the function name with the appropriate parameters.

- Syntax:

-Function_name()
0r
-function_name(parameter1, parameter2)

# *Lambda functions*

- A shortcut to write and define functions in python.

- They do not have a name and are called anonymous functions.

- we define them using the keyword lambda

- Structure for a lambda:

-lambda arguments : expression


- Can take any number or arguments but only one expression.

-example

lambda num1,num2:num1+num2
