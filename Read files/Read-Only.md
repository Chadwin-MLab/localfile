- We us it to restrict the manipulation of sequences of values

- we can only fetch and read from them

# *Creating tuples*

- can be created by placing the sequence inside the parenthesis().

- Comma-separated values.

# *Manipulating tuples*

- *Accessing elements of a tuple*

-index starts from zero



- *Tuple Slicing*



- *Updating a tuple(Not possible)*

-Cannot be updated


- *Deleting elements from a tuple*


# *Tuple functions*

- len(tuple) returns the length of the tuple

- min(tuple) returns the elements of the tuples with the minimum value

- max(tuple) returns the elements of the tuple with the maximum value
