# Here is a sample to get input from the user

input("Please enter your name:")

# It will return "Please enter your name:" prompting the user to enter a name, but will do nothing we then need to store it somewhere to engage it

username = input("Please enter your name:")

print(username)

#Lets now check the data type

print(type(username))

#It should return <class "str">
